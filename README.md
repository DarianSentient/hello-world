# hello-world
Test repository, for tutorial purposes.

Initial edit is in. It's pretty insubstantial, but delightfully self-referential.

Second edit, now that I'm sufficiently competent in Unity prototyping to move into AI and Tensorflow experimentation. Since all of the ml-agents files are based on GitHub, now's the time for me to get my Git on.

Third edit, this time made into the local repository copy on my computer. Should I be able to sync this properly, I can consider making a public repository for Unity project retention purposes.
