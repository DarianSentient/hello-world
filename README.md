Test repository, for tutorial purposes.

Initial edit is in. It's pretty insubstantial, but delightfully self-referential.

Second edit, now that I'm sufficiently competent in Unity prototyping to move into AI and Tensorflow experimentation. Since all of the ml-agents files are based on GitHub, now's the time for me to get my Git on.
